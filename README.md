# GWU-Explorer
GWU Explorer, is a simple app to help GWU students living on campus quickly get from Foggy Bottom to a desired destination using 
the area’s highly available and totally reliable Metro subway system.

The app features the ability to input a destination address or landmark name, view the Metro path in a list, share the trip directions 
with friends, view the equivalent driving directions, and also view current rail alerts and delays.
The project demonstrates the Android concepts of **geocoding, SharedPreferences, RecyclerViews, RESTful APIs, error handling, and 
both implicit and explicit Intents**.
